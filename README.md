## Smart Tool Selection

The nodes intelligently select the appropriate search tool based on your configuration:

### When URL Context is Enabled:
- **Tool Used**: `urlContext` - Analyzes content from specific URLs
- **Behavior**: Appends URLs to your query for targeted research
- **Best For**: Researching specific websites, documentation, or articles

### When URL Context is Disabled:
- **Tool Used**: `googleSearch` - General web search
- **Behavior**: Performs broad web searches across the internet
- **Best For**: General information gathering, current events, broad topics

## Example Workflows

### Basic Search

1. Create a new workflow
2. Add a "Gemini Search Tool" node
3. Configure your API credentials
4. Enter a search query
5. Execute and view the search results

### URL-Specific Research

1. Create a new workflow
2. Add a "Gemini Search" node
3. Set operation to "Web Search"
4. Enable "URL Context Tool"
5. Add specific URLs in "Restrict Search to URLs" (e.g., `docs.example.com,api.example.com`)
6. Enter your research query
7. Execute to get targeted results from those specific sites

### Organization-Focused Search

1. Create a new workflow
2. Add a "Gemini Search Tool" node
3. Enable "Organization Context"
4. Enter organization name (e.g., "OpenAI", "Google", "Microsoft")
5. Enter your search query
6. Execute to get results focused on that organization

### Advanced Content Generation

1. Create a new workflow
2. Add a "Gemini Search" node
3. Set operation to "Generate Content"
4. Configure model and prompt
5. Adjust temperature and token settings as needed
6. Execute to generate AI content

## Using as a Tool

This node can be used as a tool in n8n AI Agents. To enable community nodes as tools, you need to set the `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE` environment variable to `true`.

### Setting the Environment Variable

#### Bash/Zsh Shell

```bash
export N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
n8n start
```

#### Docker (docker-compose.yml)

```yaml
environment:
  - N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

#### Desktop App

Create a `.env` file in the n8n directory:

```
N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

#### Permanent Setting (Mac/Linux)

Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
export N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ALLOW_TOOL_USAGE=true
```

## Credentials

This node requires a Google Gemini API key. You can get one from the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).
